# Friendly Football ⚽️

**The grassroots football network** — connecting teams, leagues, and tournaments for friendly matches and open fixtures.

## 🌍 Concept
- Teams can post open friendly slots (age group, location, home/away)
- Leagues can post last-minute drop-out fixtures
- Organisers can post open tournament places
- Teams can apply and confirm matches instantly

## 💡 Why it matters
Grassroots football teams currently rely on Facebook groups and WhatsApp chats to find friendlies. Friendly Football makes it simple, organised, and fast — all in one place.

## 🚧 Current status
Planning & design stage — development starting soon.
